        <section> <!--info about the problem-->
            <p>Pogchamp is an emote on the streaming platform twitch. 
                this has become an interesting emote because of the face behind the emote 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/gootecks">Gootecks</a></p>
            <h4>So why is this interesting?</h4>
            <p>Well Pogchamp in the gaming community is like a van gough painting in the art community its something highly valued for its entrepratated meaning
                wich is literally perfection, if you do something that is "Pog" you exceeded all expectations and did something extrordinary
            </p>
            <p>So now this is the cause, effect and what we can expect in the future</p>

              due to this lovely statement...i think this pogchamp emote needs to be removed.

            <!--Cant figure out how to get this alligned nicly in the middle-->
            <p>This is what made twitch remove the emote from their platform, a single tweet reffering to 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">the storming of capitol hill</a>
            Now this might not look as a bad thing at first glance but... if we consider the size of his platform and the event 
            that took place this is what is known as a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/call%20to%20arms"> Call to arms</a>
            He is also reffering to 2 separete alt right sources for more information.
            </p>
            <h4>Cant a call to arms be a good thing?</h4>
            <p>Well Yes! a call to arms can be a good thing, but calling for justice for perpretrators currently wanted by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/capitol-violence">FBI</a>
                is a way of deflecting from the real issue, the instigated violence and storming of the capitol.</p>

        <section id="Solution"> <!--How twitch Fixes the problem-->
            <h3>The solution to a Non problem</h3>
            <p>Twitch is a company owned by amazon, wich is owned by <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>. 
            so a daughter company of the riches man in the world associating themselfs with a extremist dosent look good for anyone.
            the solution was simple effective and WRONG
            </p>

                </ol>
            </nav>
            <h5>So whats wrong with this solution?</h5>
            <p>Well they are resolving a non issue, i mean if we start judging art by the one who drew it and not for what it 
            represents and what we entrepratated it as we might aswell cansel most classical art pieces and most of the statues from aincent greece
            so i believe it would be more efficient to appriciate the art for what it is and not who made it</p>
            <p>and honestly these "Newchamp" emotes does not carry the same emotional weight as the original pogchamp these are just blank slates of what was</p>

            <p>I must give them credit for this, its actually a really cool idea, but again they are compleatly forgetting what Pogchamp means</p>
            <p>Its really hard to say whats the correct way of doing this, but i think they might be on the right path</p>

        <section id="TheRealProblem"> <!--Dank Memes-->
            <H3>The Real Problem And What to do</H3>
            <p>so the real problem here is the cancell culture that we have in the online space,
                twitch can condemn Gootecks for his actions while still keeping the emote
            <b>THERE IS NO DUBBLE STANDARD THERE</b> there is no need to activly remove every edgie person from all online platforms
                actually this is a main cause for the Polarisation we are experiencing in our society
            </p>
            <h5>The solution?</h5>
            <p>try to be more inclusive, meet new people, experience real life, but most importantly SPAM PEPEGA</p>
